I write scripts and documentation to share and benefit other like minded people. I have stumbled across massively helpful technicial blog posts that helped me fix a problem before, I want to help others in the same way. I mainly write about OpenBSD, but I also do Linux and FreeBSD things too time to time.


I can be reached at the below email address for questions, comments, suggestions.
