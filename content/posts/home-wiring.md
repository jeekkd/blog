Recently we completed a large renovation of our house, one that involved having some of the walls open. During that time I thought it would be a great opportunity to wire the house with ethernet. I was very excited about this opportunity since it would mean my office could be hardwired. The actual cost of the project, and the time required was fairly moderate - here is what I purchased.
